#  General Topology - Logika v računalništvu student project

## Project Roadmap

### Baseline
- [ ] topology
- [ ] topological space
- [ ] concrete examples
  - [ ] trivial topology
  - [ ] discreet topology
  - [ ] cofinite topology
- [ ] continous map
- [ ] homeomorphism
- [ ] basis
- [ ] subbasis
- [ ] covering
- [ ] density
- [ ] subspaces
- [ ] induced topology
- [ ] regular space

### Main Goal
- [ ] alternative characterisation for continous maps
- [ ] characterisation of homomorphism
- [ ] first countable spaces
- [ ] second countable spaces
- [ ] separable spaces
- [ ] separation axioms
- [ ] basis
- [ ] projections are open and continuous 
- [ ] compact spaces

### Abvove and Beyond
- [ ] basis and maps theorem - checking for continuity
- [ ] basis generationg topology
- [ ] product topology
- [ ] properties of a Housdorff space

### Self Harm
- [ ] real numbers
- [ ] T3 1/2 and upper
- [ ] metric spaces 
- [ ] normal spaces
- [ ] connected spaces
- [ ] weak topology

### Absolute Hell
- [ ] homotopy
- [ ] fibres
- [ ] cover spaces
- [ ] homology (just basics)
- [ ] cohomology (just basics)
- [ ] manifolds
- [ ] 

### Hahaha
- [ ] existance of non-triangulatable Manifolds
- [ ] all of the above
- [ ] learning agda
